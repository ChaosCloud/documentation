Value Stream Map {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
================

### Introduction {#introduction .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Value Stream Map helps you visualize your CI/CD workflow. With a single
click, it allows you to trace a commit from when it is checked in up to
when it is deployed.

![](resources/images/cruise/value_stream_map/whole_map.png)

A value stream map can be drawn for every instance of a pipeline. It
provides you with the ability to:

-   See what caused the current pipeline to be triggered.
-   See what downstream pipelines were triggered by the current
    pipeline.
-   See the status of the current pipeline and all its upstream and
    downstream dependencies.
-   See changes in dependencies of the pipeline across different runs of
    it.

Along with all this, it also allows you to easily debug problems when a
dependency/configuration change caused your build-test-release setup to
break.

### Understanding the Value Stream Map {#understanding .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

The Value Stream Map is laid out as an end-to-end dependency graph. The
graph originates from source control materials and flows from left to
right.

The pipeline instance for which the Value Stream Map is being viewed is
the main pipeline and is highlighted. Everything to the left of this
pipeline are its upstream dependencies, ie all the materials that have
contributed to this instance. Everything to the right are its downstream
dependencies, ie, all the pipelines that it can potentially trigger or
contribute to.

### Upstream Dependencies {#upstream .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

The upstream dependencies of the main pipeline are taken from history
and show all the source control and pipeline dependency materials that
have contributed to the main pipeline. Even when the Go Configuration
changes after a certain instance of a pipeline, its upstream dependency
graph will continue to reflect the older configuration with which it was
run. This also means that it would display pipelines that do not exist
in the configuration any more.

Let us assume that instance '1' of pipeline 'Build' is as below

![](resources/images/cruise/value_stream_map/upstream.png)

If the configuration changes to replace the pipeline 'Services' with 2
pipelines - 'Service-1' and 'Service-2', the next instance of pipeline
'Build' would reflect the change.

Value Stream Map of pipeline 'Build' with counter '1' would look as
below

### Downstream Dependencies {#downstream .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

The downstream dependencies of the main pipeline instance indicate what
can happen with it. This information is always taken from the latest
configuration. Pipelines that have not run yet are also shown

![](resources/images/cruise/value_stream_map/downstream_unrun_instance.png)

If Environment-1 is removed from the configuration, the Value Stream Map
for the same instance of 'Build' would look as below.

![](resources/images/cruise/value_stream_map/downstream_pipeline_deleted.png)

### Multiple Pipeline Instances {#multiple .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

A pipeline could be re-triggered multiple times with the same revision.
In such cases, all the instances are shown in descending order against
that pipeline. In the below example, 'Deploy' has been triggered thrice
with counter '2' of pipeline 'FunctionalTests'.

### Viewing the Value Stream Map {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Every pipeline label in Go directs you to the value stream map of that
instance of the pipeline.

### Permissions {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

The permissions required to view a value stream map are as follows:

-   Go Administrators have access to the value stream maps of all the
    pipelines that are configured.
-   Users with view permissions for a pipeline will be able to view the
    value stream map for all instances of that pipeline.

However, there is one special case to be noted where the pipeline
details might not be shown completely. If the user does not have view
permissions for a pipeline in the Value Stream Map, its details, like
the stages and instances run will not be shown.

If you are using Internet Explorer as your browser please note that
Value Stream Map is supported with only versions 9 and above.
