What's new in Go {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
================

Go has changed it's release naming convention from the previous practice
of major.minor.bugfix nomenclature. The major version will now be the
year of release (YY). The minor version n will indicate the nth release
for the year. For ex: 13.2 will be the second release in 2013.

### Bug fixes {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Parsing of NUnit (Version 2.6) XML report.

### Go 13.3 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

### Features {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   [External Package
    Repositories:](package_material.html#package_material) Go supports
    external packages repositories as materials, and changes to packages
    in these repositories can trigger Go pipelines.

### Enhancements {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   RPM installer can optionally defer starting of the Go Server upon
    upgrade. Setting the environment variable DO\_NOT\_START\_SERVICE=Y
    will defer starting Go Server upon installation/upgrade.

    with regards to Go Server startup time.
-   UI changes to move user related actions under a menu item which will
    appear when a user clicks on his/her username on the header.

### Others {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   As per our earlier [deprecation
    notice](http://support.thoughtworks.com/entries/23397228-Go-s-support-for-non-SDK-TFS-polling-deprecated-as-of-13-1),
    Go has removed support for TF CLC and Visual Studio clients when
    using TFS.

### Go 13.2.2 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

### Bug fixes {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Fixed bug in SVN Post-Commit hook implementation to handle commits
    in quick succession
-   Microsoft TFS SDK downgrade - the TFS SDK was upgraded from v10.1 to
    v11.0 in Go 13.2.1 but a few customers reported that their TFS
    material updates started failing intermittently. It looks like there
    was a [memory leak in TFS SDK
    v11.0](https://bitbucket.org/stellaritysoftware/tfs-repository-plugin/issue/11/memory-leak-in-tfs-sdk),
    therefore we are reverting to TFS SDK v10.1 with this minor release
    of Go to take the time and investigate the issue further.

Go 13.2.1 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
---------

### Enhancements {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   [Template View:](pipeline_templates.html#view_template) All Pipeline

    creating or editing pipelines.
-   [User Delete API:](users_api.html) A new API using which you can
    delete a disabled user.
-   Check-in comments in [Value Stream Map:](value_stream_map.html)
    Showing more details, like the check-in comment, date and author for
    every Source Control Material in the Value Stream Map.
-   [Improving Server Startup
    Time:](performance_tuning.html#server_startup_time) The database
    queries that run when the server starts, have been optimized. Also,
    additional JVM properties have been provided to delay material
    polling and pipeline scheduling, thereby, improving start up time.

### Bug fixes {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Go 13.2 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
-------

### New features {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   [**Value Stream Map**](value_stream_map.html): Visualize end-to-end
    pipeline dependency. See what revisions triggered a pipeline and
    which dependent pipelines were triggered by it. Track changes from
    check-in to deploy.
-   [**Better support for concurrent edits to
    configuration**](concurrent_config_modifications.html)
    -   Config Merge : Multiple users' changes to configuration are now
        merged by Go.
    -   Split Pane : A user-friendly interface appears in the config xml
        tab in case of a merge conflict. It displays the latest config
        as well as the user's changes, so that a Go administrator can
        edit config without losing any changes!
-   [Support for named branches in
    Mercurial](configuration_reference.html#hg)
-   [**Config Diff**](stage_old_config.html): Go administrator can now
    view configuration changes between two stage runs.

-   Ability to specify if a pipeline is manual or automatic from
    pipeline options page.
-   A file called wrapper-properties.conf can now be created in windows
    installations to hold custom properties. This can be done on both
    [server](installing_go_server.html#windows_install_server) and
    [agent](installing_go_agent.html#windows_install_agent) to avoid
    overwriting custom properties during upgrade.

### Bug fixes {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Case sensitivity issue with pipeline name in pipeline material.
-   Temporary agent launcher files do not get deleted when Windows
    machine is shutdown.

### Go 13.1 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

### New features {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   **[Command Repository](command_repository.html)** : How do I run
    maven with Go? Is it possible to do an EC2 deploy with Go? What is
    the syntax if I need to execute a remote command on a linux box? The
    answer to these and more are now provided within Go.

### Enhancements {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   **[Notification if material update is
    hung](material_update_hung.html)** : Go server becomes less
    responsive when some of the processes that it invokes to do material
    updates stop responding. Now you get to know when this happens and
    take suitable steps.
-   Support for multiple organizational units (OUs) in [LDAP
    configuration](dev_authentication.html#ldap_authentication). This
    allows finer-grained access control. If your organization has
    multiple OUs in your corporate LDAP, you can now to choose to
    specify those OUs, whose users are allowed to use Go.
-   [Additional agent APIs](Agent_API.html): Go now provides an API to
    list details of all agents and another API to delete disabled
    agents.
-   Ability to seach community forum from help documentation. You can
    now look up community articles from within the help documentation by
    clicking the Help icon on the center right of each help page.

### UI changes {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Docking of primary header
-   Docking of breadcrumbs

### Bug fixes {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   When a "run on all agents" job involves more than 100 agents, some
    of the jobs failed reporting completion
-   Run-if conditions is shown for Cancel task
-   Extraction of [pipeline templates](pipeline_templates.html) not
    retaining parameters
-   Fan-in resolution not happening in some scenarios
-   nunit test reports not parsed by Go due to case-sensitivity of file
    extension
-   New pipeline created without using templates shows parameters of the
    first template, if any
-   cctray breakers list returns 'Unknown' as breakers when pipeline has
    dependency material
-   Default column not retained for large search results in add user
    screen

    the same is not reflected in the screen until refresh
-   In certain conditions, sorting of Agents by Free Space throws error
    when using OpenJDK.

Go 12.4 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
-------

### New features {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   **Support for OpenJDK** : Oracle JDK (formerly Sun JDK) is no longer
    a mandatory requirement for Go server and agent. Go now needs a Java
    Runtime Environment (JRE) with version 6 or above - either Oracle or
    Open JRE.
-   **[Post-commit hook for Subversion](materials_api.html)** : In
    organizations with a large number of subversion repositories,
    regular polling can lead to huge network traffic. The generic
    post-commit hook avoids the need for regular polling. It enables
    appropriate Go pipelines to be triggered based on the commit to the
    corresponding SVN repository.

### Performance Improvements {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   **Go configuration saves are faster** : Enterprise installations
    have large configurations, which also undergo a lot of changes.
    Optimizations have been done to reduce the time taken in this area.
-   Better handling of cctray requests while server is starting to
    improve dashboard accessibilty.

### Enhancements {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

    readability of commit messages.
-   Go now deletes the associated cache as part of [auto deletion of
    artifacts](delete_artifacts.html).
-   The username of the user who triggered a build is now available as a
    [job environment
    variable](dev_use_current_revision_in_build.html#standard).
-   On Windows, Go service no longer needs Admin privileges. It runs
    with Local System Account
-   Official support for Google Chrome browser.
-   Better error message when licensing limitation is reached

### Bug fixes {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Minor UI issues
-   Stage feed for pipeline fails when all the materials of the pipeline
    triggered with lower revision compared to the previous trigger
-   Case sensitivity issue with pipeline name in path and config
-   Unable to delete a user role if it contains dots
-   Tests tab under jobs shows no results if the results were in
    subfolders of the test reports folder.
-   Memory leak due to open password file
-   Custom tabs with external contents renders incorrectly

Go 12.3.2 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
---------

### Bug fixes {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   *Fan-In* feature corner cases.
-   Failure when a Stage feed contains historical dependent pipelines
    that were deleted from the configuration.
-   [Missing horizontal scroll on Job console
    page](http://support.thoughtworks.com/entries/21955113-scroll-bar-does-not-show-up-for-console-output-until-it-is-complete).

### Performance Improvements {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Upgraded JGit library.
    [Details](http://wiki.eclipse.org/JGit/New_and_Noteworthy/2.0).

Go 12.3.1 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
---------

### Enhancements {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   **Go server for Mac OSX - Lion and Mountain Lion** : Are you a
    Lion/Mountain Lion user and could not try out Go? Go Server app now
    works on the new Mac versions. Do remember that Mac Go server is
    primarily for evaluation.
-   **Logging LDAP login failures** : Enterprise customers can
    troubleshoot LDAP errors or login failures faster, thanks to
    improved logging support.
-   **UI improvements** : Console and custom tabs now extend to the
    height of the browser window. And we have a "Top" icon to quickly
    get you upto the top of the page.
-   **[Filter agents by exact search](agents_page.html#exact_search)** :
    Now you can specify the values in quotes to do an exact search. The
    result - you get exactly what you want and nothing more.

### Bug fixes {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Fixed an error triggering a pipeline on the environments page

Go 12.3 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
-------

### New Features {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   **[Go's new "Fan-in" feature allows you to model your workflow to
    fail fast](fan_in.html):** Continuous Delivery is about failing fast
    to learn fast. Early failure is cheap and easy to fix. So it really
    comes down to getting short feedback loops across your
    build-test-release workflow. What can you do with "fan-out" and
    "fan-in"?
    -   package the right versions of your components - eliminate
        spurious builds
    -   parallelize testing activities in different environments to find
        issues as quickly as possible
-   **[Are you happy with a pipeline and are ready to create a template?
    Extract a template!](pipeline_templates.html):** This makes scaling
    easier and promotes consistency in your build-test-release workflow.
    A common use case is when you want to start using your deployment
    mechanism across multiple environments.
-   **[Pipeline Group administrators can now view and edit the
    underlying XML configuration](pipeline_group_admin_config.html).**
    Some administrative tasks are easier done using XML (and believe it
    or not some users prefer XML!). We took this away in a previous
    release and are bringing it back in a better form.

### Enhancements {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   **[Silent (Unattended) Windows
    Installer](installing_go_agent.html).** You no longer need to stick
    (and click) around when you install a Windows agent. Thank you for
    your patience!
-   **Your [CCtray client](go_integration.html#cctray)** now shows you
    who broke the build
-   **[API to cancel a stage](Stages_API.html)**

### Go Community Edition {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Go Community now has access to all features
-   Teams of up to 10 users can now have access to a fully featured
    Continous Delivery tool for free
-   This includes [templates](pipeline_templates.html), [Go
    Environments](managing_environments.html), pipeline groups and
    pipeline group security

### Bugs Fixed {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   The **[Pipeline Compare](compare_pipelines.html)** now uses *push
    date* and not *author commit date*.
-   Check connection issue with Perforce

Go 12.2.2 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
---------

### New Features {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   **TFS SDK Support:** Go Server uses[TFS Java SDK
    v10](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22616),
    as the default,to support TFS materials from this release. Usage of
    SDK makes the TFS implementation scale better. The requirement of
    having TFS Command line utility as a pre-requisite fro TFS support
    is no longer necessary.
-   **Go Server ID:** New
    [serverID](configuration_reference.html#server) attribute has been
    added to server tag in the config XML to assist Go Server
    identification in deployment environments involving multiple Go
    servers.

### Performance Enhancements {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Memory usage during the process of test artifact analysis has been
    optimized. This will result in reduced memory footprint of the Go
    server.
-   TFS CLC command and TFS Visual Studio Command implementations for
    modification check on the server has been optimized. No workspace
    and work folder mapping is being done on the server side to
    determine modifications in TFS repository.

Go 12.2.1 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
---------

Performance fixes encompassing - memory usage optimization and
concurrency.

Go 12.2 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
-------

### New Features {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   **[Use Environment Variables for
    passwords](deploy_a_specific_build_to_an_environment.html#secure_variables_section):**
    Go's environment variables now have an encryption option so that you
    can comfortably and safely store and use passwords in Go. You and
    your auditors will be happy.
-   **[Store each artifact in one place and then fetch it whenever and
    wherever](managing_dependencies.html#fetch_artifact_section):** You
    can now fetch artifacts from any ancestor pipeline. For example,
    this comes in handy when you want to deploy the same binaries using
    the same deployment process to various environments. This ensures
    you test your deployment process many times all the way out to
    production.

### Enhancements {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   **[New environment variables for material
    revisions](dev_use_current_revision_in_build.html):** Two additional
    environment variables GO\_FROM\_REVISION and GO\_TO\_REVISION have
    been introduced during the run of every task. This is useful when a
    pipeline instance picks up mutiple changesets from your SCM material
    and you have tasks that need information on which files have changed
    in this instance.

### Bugs fixed {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Fetch Artifact task can be used to fetch artifacts from a particular
    stage in an [upstream
    pipeline](managing_dependencies.html#fetch_artifact_section) or
    stages before it. Stages after the upstream stage **can not** be
    fetched from, because they may not be complete when the fetch task
    executes. Prior to 12.2 Go would allow fetching artifacts from
    stages after the upstream stage in the pipeline.\
     For example: Let pipeline 'build' have 3 stages named 'compile',
    'package' and 'test'. Let a downstream pipeline 'deploy' have a
    dependency on the 'package' stage of 'build'. With this dependency
    you can fetch artifacts from 'package' or any stage before that i.e
    'compile'. From Go 12.2, you cannot fetch artifacts from the 'test'
    stage with this dependency. To fix this, you will have to change the
    dependency to the 'test' stage of 'build'. With this dependency you
    can fetch artifacts from any stage of the pipeline i.e 'test' or any
    stage before that.

    This fix is not backward compatible. Hence, configurations violating
    this rule need to be fixed manually before upgrading to this
    version.

Go 12.1 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
-------

### New Features {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   **[Support for TFS SCM](tfs_config.html):** Use TFS as a material
    for your pipeline.
-   **[One-click backup](one_click_backup.html):** Use the
    administration interface to backup Go.

### Enhancements {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   **Permanently pause pipelines:** The state of a paused pipeline and
    comment is maintained across server restarts. Hence, you can now
    permanently disable pipelines without losing historical data for a
    pipeline.

Go 2.4 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
------

### Performance Enhancements {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   **[Tune Go for Better Performance](performance_tuning.html):** Go
    has been tested with a large number of pipelines, agents and load.
    Performance will vary based on your server configuration and usage
    patterns. Use this guide to optimize performance.
-   **Faster Dashboard:** The [Pipelines
    Dashboard](Pipelines_Dashboard_page.html) renders much faster even
    with a large number of pipelines.
-   **Faster Artifact Transfers:** We reduced artifact upload and
    download times.
-   **Other:** We improved how Go manages memory.

### New Features {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   **[Filter on Agents page](agents_page.html):** Use tag:value style
    syntax to easily find the agents you want to manage.
-   **[Auto registration of remote agents](agent_auto_register.html):**
    You can now auto approve remote agents without having to enable them
    through the agents dashboard.

### Enhancements {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   **Personalize the Pipelines Dashboard:** This is now a user
    preference in Go.
-   The online
    [documentation](http://www.thoughtworks.com/products/docs/go/current/help/)
    now has search so you can quickly get help.
-   Get the list of [scheduled jobs](Pipeline_API.html) using API.
-   Configure site urls using the server configuration UI.
-   Users will get a warning if the Go license is about to expire

### Bugs fixed {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   GO\_P4\_CLIENT environment variable had different behaviour when
    destination directory is set for perforce materials.

Go 2.3 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
------

### New Features {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   **[Visualize build duration over time](stage_duration_chart.html):**
    Visualize trends in your build's duration with a brand new graphical
    chart
-   **[Clone a pipeline](admin_clone_pipeline.html):** Use the admin UI
    to clone an existing pipeline.
-   **[3 Step Pipeline Wizard](quick_pipeline_setup.html):** Use the new
    pipeline wizard to create a pipeline is 3 easy steps.
-   **[Job history on an agent](agent_details.html):** You can view the
    history of all the work done by an agent. Analyze problems in your
    execution environment to identify flaky jobs on particular agents.
-   **[Trace a pipeline instance back to its
    configuration](stage_old_config.html):** Go now maintains a history
    of all changes made to its configuration allowing you to audit all
    configuration changes. You can view the Go configuration for each
    run in the Config tab for a stage.
-   **[Job Timeout](job_timeout.html):** Non-responsive jobs are now
    detected by Go and can be configured to automatically cancel after a
    timeout period.
-   **[Auto purge old artifacts](delete_artifacts.html):** Configure Go
    to manage server disk space by automatically purging old artifacts.
-   **[Artifact integrity verification](artifact_integrity.html):** Go
    verifies every file retrieved from its repository to ensure it
    hasn't been tampered with.

### Enhancements {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Perforce users can now make use of the GO\_P4\_CLIENT environment
    variable which indicates the perforce client name.
-   Configure and manage custom tabs for your jobs using the admin UI.
-   You can now browse the history to select a pipeline on the[Pipeline
    Compare screen](compare_pipelines.html).
-   The Stages XML feed now includes additional details on the material
    check-in that triggered the pipeline and information on related
    mingle cards.
-   Usernames and roles are case insensitive. Existing roles or
    usernames which have multiple entries that differ only in case will
    be replaced by a single instance.

Go 2.2 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
------

### New Features {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   **[Pipeline Compare](compare_pipelines.html):** Go now gives you the
    ability to select any two pipeline instances and see exactly what
    changed between the two builds. The comparison will display a list
    of checkins grouped by material. If you use Mingle 3.3 (or greater)
    to manage your project, you can [associate a Mingle
    project](mingle_card_activity_gadget.html) to a pipeline to see a
    list of cards that were worked on in the compare range.
-   **[Pipeline Administration](managing_pipelines.html):** A brand new
    UI for administering pipelines which eliminates the need to
    configure via XML.
-   **Password Encryption:** All passwords stored in Go's configuration
    file are now encrypted for increased security. In prior versions,
    although passwords were only accessible by system administrators,
    they were visible in plain text. This is no longer the case.
-   **Version Controlled Configuration:** Go now maintains a history of
    all changes made to its configuration allowing you to audit all
    configuration changes.
-   **[Job Re-runs](job_rerun.html):** Go now allows you to re-run
    specific jobs like it was possible to re-run stages. This helps in
    cases like environment problems where you had to rerun an entire
    stage. Job re-run gets you to the same state with lower agent
    utilization and potentially sooner.

### Enhancements {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Go Community no longer requires a license key.
-   Grant and remove administrative privilege for users from the "User
    Summary" screen.
-   The "Trigger with Options" popup now lets you search by a material
    pipeline's label.

Go 2.1 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
------

### New Features {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   The ability to authorize people to[administer the configuration of
    pipeline groups](delegating_group_administration.html). This is
    especially useful if multiple projects/teams share a single Go
    server - it means boxes can be centrally managed, but teams are in
    control of their build configuration.
-   Go Pipeline Gadget with OAuth 2.0 so that you can embed a view of a
    pipeline in any compliant OpenSocial container.
-   Pipeline level Atom feeds
-   A GUI for creating and configuring environments
-   A GUI for server and user management
-   Manage Go users from the administration UI

-   [Agent API - Enable and disable an agent](Agent_API.html)
-   [Scheduling a pipeline with specific material
    revisions](Pipeline_API.html#scheduling)
-   [Releasing a pipeline lock](Pipeline_API.html#releasing)

### Changes {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

#### Agents {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   [Bulk edit of agent
    resources](managing_a_build_cloud.html#jobstoagents)
-   [Bulk enable and disable
    agents](managing_a_build_cloud.html#jobstoagents)

#### Scheduling {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Go now recognizes when you use the same source control repository in
    multiple pipelines, and only polls it once per minute, regardless of
    how many times it's referenced.
-   In previous versions Go would not poll repositories in a manual
    pipeline. Go will now poll all repositories by default. You can
    prevent automatic updating of a material by setting
    autoUpdate="false" on the material.

#### Environment variables {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   CRUISE\_XXX variables are deprecated since Go 2.0. Please use
    GO\_XXX instead of CRUISE\_XXX (For example: GO\_SERVER\_URL instead
    of CRUISE\_SERVER\_URL).

Cruise 1.3.2 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
------------

### New features {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   [Go watches the disk space available for database and shows a
    warning message when it becomes low.](admin_out_of_disk_space.html)
-   [Go shows the disk space available for pipelines folder under agent
    installation root.](agents_page.html)
-   [Pipeline label can now be customized by material revisions
    number.](build_labelling.html)
-   [Link directly from pipeline history page to the different stage
    histories.](pipeline_activity_page.html)

### Changes {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Go uses pipeline counter instead of label in
    [artifacts](Artifacts_API.html) and
    [properties](Properties_API.html) Restful urls.
-   Mercurial material no longer updates the working copy on the server
    when checking for modifications.
-   Go now schedules pipelines concurrently.
-   Go will use the first changed material as build cause.

### Fixed {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Go no longer always executes 'hg clone' when the url ends with /.

### Known issues {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Pipelines with Mercurial or Git materials may initially take a long
    time to schedule. This is due to the command 'clone' running with
    high CPU usage.

Cruise 1.3.1 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
------------

-   Improved performance and configurability Agent/Server communication.
    Go now supports \>100 agents.
-   Improved performance for configurations with a large number of
    pipelines and materials defined.
-   Go will always use the latest revision for filtered materials once
    scheduled.

### Fixed {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Fixed the concurrency issue with a large number of pipelines on
    Current Activity Page.
-   Fixed installers on Mac in terms of upgraded package of Mac in June.

    to schedule build.
-   Fixed issue where agent console logger threads are not always
    stopped.

Cruise 1.3 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
----------

### New features {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Go watch artifacts disk space and show warning message when it
    becomes low.
-   [User tab to manage email notifications, with the ability to match
    check-ins to users](dev_notifications.html)
-   [Run multiple Go agents on one
    machine](admin_install_multiple_agents.html)
-   [Cancelling a stage can run a process to clean up on the
    agent](dev_clean_up_when_cancel.html)
-   [Conditional task execution for
    jobs](dev_conditional_task_execution.html)
-   Support for [Git branches and
    submodules](configuration_reference.html#git)
-   Go server warns you when its disk space is running low
-   [Set environment variables containing the source control revision id
    when running a task](dev_use_current_revision_in_build.html)
-   We now support SUSE
    [[server](installing_go_server.html#install-linux)|[agent](installing_go_agent.html#install-linux)]
    (tested on Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP2).
-   We now support Solaris
    [[server](installing_go_server.html#install-solaris)|[agent](installing_go_agent.html#install-solaris)]
    (tested on SunOS Solaris10 5.10).

In the professional edition:

-   [Ability to group (and secure) similar
    pipelines](dev_authorization.html#pipeline-groups)
-   [Pipeline dependencies](managing_dependencies.html)
-   [Lock down who can view and operate
    pipelines](dev_authorization.html)
-   More than one material per pipeline

### Changes {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Changes with multiple materials highlights what has actually changed
    since the previous revision. If you used multiple materials (e.g.
    more than one source control) in the same pipeline, Go shows the
    latest revision for each of the materials, even if that is the same
    as the previous pipeline instance. Go now highlights the changes
    since the previous pipeline instance.
-   You can now define groups of pipelines. This makes it easier to
    configure and define security on pipelines based on logical grouping
    for your organization. See [change permissions for different
    actions](dev_authorization.html) for more information.
-   Go server can now be downloaded as a single jar. For more
    information see [running Go without an
    install](run_go_without_install.html).
-   The "Pipelines" tab has been removed. The Pipeline Activity page
    provides a much better visualizatiion.
-   Manual pipelines no longer poll source control. A pipeline with a
    manual first stage will not check source control until it is
    manually triggered. This helps reduce the number of requests to
    source control systems.
-   Artifacts to be uploaded can now be specified with wildcards. For
    more information see [uploading test
    reports](dev_upload_test_report.html).
-   Artifacts are now stored on the server in directories named for the
    pipelines. The directory for a pipeline is
    "pipelineName/pipelineLabel/stageName/stageCounter/jobName".
    Artifacts already created will still be accessible in the existing
    directories, but new pipelines will use the new directory layout,
    This was done since some operating systems restrict the number of
    directory entries which can cause errors when building many
    pipelines.
-   Go will now obscure show source control passwords. Go will show
    passwords as "\*\*\*\*\*\*" in the UI and in logs. Note that only
    the logs created by Go itself are obscured. If a tool or script
    prints out a password then it may appear in the logs.
-   Forcing a pipeline will create a new pipeline instance even if there
    are no changes in the materials. In Cruise 1.2 forcing a pipeline
    would re-run the existing pipeline if there were no changes in the
    materials. After feedback from our users we have removed this
    change. If you do want to re-run an existing pipeline instance you
    can still do so, by clicking the re-run button on the first stage of
    that pipeline.
-   Upgraded jetty to 6.1.18 with better performance.
-   Use the nio selector from jetty to improve SSL performance.
-   Licensing has been changed. You will need a new license if you have
    a paid version. Please go
    [here](http://www.thoughtworks.com/products/go-continuous-delivery/compare)
    to see details.

Cruise 1.2.1 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
------------

### Changes {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Fixed the issue of full-checkout on agent side for Perforce.
-   Fixed the issue of full-checkout on agent side for when the option
    of 'checkexternals' is on.
-   Manually triggering a pipeline will generate a new pipeline instance
    even though there is no modification detected. Also it will update
    to most recent revision, including filtered files.

Cruise 1.2 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
----------

### New features {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Cruise 1.2 offers many new features and enhancements in terms of
usability and performance.

#### Support tracking tools to integrate with other management tools. {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Go now supports linking to a story / bug tracking tool like Mingle from
commit messages in Go. Use the folloing syntax:

``` {.code}
<pipeline name="cruise">
    <trackingtool link="http://mingle/projects/cruise/cards/${ID}" regex="#(\d+)"/>
    ...
</pipeline>
```

**Description:** Using the regular expression above, if your commit
messages contain messages of the form '\#2350', you could see the link
wherever you can see the commit message.

![](resources/images/cruise/pipeline_activity_tracking_tool.png)

#### Set properties from artifact using XPath automatically. {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

After a job has finished on an agent, Go can parse any XML files on the
agent and set properties on the server. You can use this to harvest
metrics like code coverage or cyclomatic complexity from your reports
into Go, and then export the complete history of your properties from
the job detail page to a spreadsheet for custom reporting and analysis.
Use the following syntax to tell Go the XML files to parse, the XPath to
get the property value, and the property name. The following example
extracts useful coverage metrics from EMMA reports..

``` {.code}
<job name="test_analysis">
    <properties>
  <property name="coverage.class" src="target/emma/coverage.xml" xpath="substring-before(//report/data/all/coverage[starts-with(@type,'class')]/@value, '%')" />
  <property name="coverage.method" src="target/emma/coverage.xml" xpath="substring-before(//report/data/all/coverage[starts-with(@type,'method')]/@value, '%')" />
  <property name="coverage.block" src="target/emma/coverage.xml" xpath="substring-before(//report/data/all/coverage[starts-with(@type,'block')]/@value, '%')" />
  <property name="coverage.line" src="target/emma/coverage.xml" xpath="substring-before(//report/data/all/coverage[starts-with(@type,'line')]/@value, '%')" />
  </properties>
  ...
</job>
```

**Description:** When you specify this configuration, you can see the
properties in the sub-tab 'properties' on job detail page, and export
their history to a spreadsheet.

![](resources/images/cruise/xpath_properties.png)

#### Improved CCTray feed {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   The performance of CCtray feed is much better than before.
-   When the stages or jobs are building, Go now supports showing the
    results of the last build.
-   The CCTray feed now supports basic authorization. Specify your
    username and pssword in the url of cctray feed like this:
    **http://[your-username]:[your-password]@yourgoserver:8153/cruise/cctray.xml**

**Notes:** some special characters do not work, e.g. '/'.

#### Support to access re-run stages. {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Although Go has always stored results of re-run stages, you can now
access previous runs of a stage easily. We've introduced a 'stage
counter' which indexes the runs of the stage.

-   The stage history is ordered by time rather than pipeline label in
    the Stage Detail Page.
-   Access any stage details page by the Go API
    http://[your\_cruise\_server]:8153/cruise/pipelines/[pipeline\_name]/[pipeline\_label]/[stage\_name]/[stage\_counter]

![](resources/images/cruise/stage_counter.png)

#### Support multiple repositories for Subversion {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Go lets you define multiple repositories in cruise-config.xml if you are
using Subversion as you VCS. This means you can easily create pipelines
for applications that rely on multiple repositories.

``` {.code}
<pipeline name="main">
    <materials>
  <svn url="http://xxx.xxx.xxx/trunk" username="yyyy" password="xxx" dest="client">
  <svn url="http://zzz.zzz.zzz/trunk" username="yyyy" password="xxx" dest="server">
    </materials>
</pipeline>
```

You can see material revisions for each pipeline in the sub-tab
'materials' on the job detail page and stage details page, and the
tooltips as well. Note that this version of Go also treats upstream
pipelines as materials, just like source control, which means you can
see exactly which version of your upstream pipeline triggered this one
(see the screenshot below). Use [this
syntax](configuration_reference.html#pipeline-dependency) to define
dependencies between pipelines.

![](resources/images/cruise/multiple_materials.png)

#### Ability to filter materials {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Go allows you to specify files in your version control repository that
shouldn't trigger a new build when they change (for example requirements
documents). You can specify multiple "ignore" blocks with patterns to
match, using ant-like syntax.

The pattern takes the root directory of the SCM repository as the root
directory, not the sandbox in the agent side or the materials URL.

For example, the structrure of a subversion repository is following:

![](resources/images/cruise/repo-structure.png)

The material and changes look like

![](resources/images/cruise/ignore-example.png)

If we want to ignore files under /trunk/lib/tmp, the configuration is:

``` {.code}
    <svn url="http://10.18.3.171:8080/svn/connect4/trunk/lib" username="cce" password="password" dest="lib">
      <filter>
        <ignore pattern="trunk/lib/tmp/**/*.*" />
      </filter>
    </svn>
    
```

#### Fetching artifacts {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Go supports fetching artifacts from previous stage or upstream pipeline
in a job by defination of \<fetchartifact\> in cruise-config.xml. Using
this feature it's easy to have one job store artifacts like binaries,
jars or installers, and then re-use them in a later stage. This supports
best practices like only compiling your application once.[Here is an
example](configuration_reference.html#fetchartifact).

### Changes {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Refactored Go API and remove some calls. See the [Go API
    topic](go_api.html) for more details.
-   Treate the dependency of pipelines as the materials of the
    pipelines. This means you can see which version of your upstream
    pipeline triggered the current pipeline anywhere on the UI you see
    modifications. Your configuration will be upgraded automatically.
-   Limit the number of materials of pipelines. Go Free Edition supports
    only one material, and Enterprise Edition support unlimited
    materials. The other versions support three materials.
-   Go agent no longer bundles Ant as of version 1.2.
-   Clean the folders which is not under any 'dest' folders of all
    mateirial on agents.

Cruise 1.1 {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
----------

### New features {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Cruise 1.1 offers many new features and enhancements in terms of
usability and performance.

#### Support for Perforce {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Go now supports Perforce. In particular, we support ticket-based
authentication.

#### Support for Git {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

The support for Git on Go is similar to the Mercurial support. Git must
be installed on both the server and agents.

#### Role-based security {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Go now allows definition of roles composed of multiple users. You
    can use these roles anywhere you would restrict access by user (to
    control administrator access, and to control who can authorize
    approvals).
-   As with 1.0, if security is switched off, Go allows all users
    anonymous read access to Go, so that anybody with access to the Go
    server can see the state of builds.

#### Authorization for approvals {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Go now allows role-based authorization for approving a stage manually.
This effectively means you can make pipelines 'read-only'. You can
specify individually for every stage which group of users or roles are
allowed to press the approval button. Specifying roles on the first
stage, if it is a manual approval, restricts who can press the "trigger
pipeline" button.

#### Re-run a stage {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Go lets you re-run individual stages. Triggering this operation will run
the stage with the same source control revisions that it was originally
run with. Go automatically updates to the original revision it was run
with. This is useful if you have a stage that deploys to a testing
environment, and you want to re-deploy a historical build to that
environment. Hover over a stage on the Pipeline Activity page or click
on the re-run button on the Current Activity page. If you re-run a stage
that failed and the stage passes then the rest of the pipeline will run
through as normal.

#### UI improvements for pipeline activity {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

The Pipeline Activity tab has an improved user interface.

![Pipeline Activity
Page](resources/images/cruise/NewPipelineActivity.png)

#### Solaris support {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

With Cruise 1.1 both the server and agents are supported on Solaris.

#### Better server error reporting {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Go will display errors on its dashboard if the server has an invalid
configuration file, if it cannot contact your revision control
repository, or if the revision control client software is not installed
on the server. The errors will go away automatically once the cause is
resolved.

#### Better console out information {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Go now reports agent actions (such as checking out, or uploading
artifacts) in the Go log that can be viewed through the web page. This
makes it much easier to debug issues with source control systems and
other Go agent actions.

![](resources/images/cruise/console_out.png)

#### De-authorize agents through UI {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

The agents can be disabled from the server through the user interface
which means that the agent will no longer process any work. Click the
Enable button to start builds on the agent again.

![Agents Page](resources/images/cruise/NewAgents.png)

#### Improved performance {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Go now uses less memory and the web pages are significantly more
responsive for very large installations with a lot of history.

### Changes {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   Go no longer bundles SVN - the server and all agents need to have
    Subversion installed and available in the system path
-   Approvals are now at the start of a stage not the end of the stage.
    This means that it is possible to add a pipeline that will only be
    run if you manually trigger it (in other words, revision control
    changes will not automatically trigger it). To do this, add a manual
    approval to the start of the first stage.
