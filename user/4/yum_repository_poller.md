Yum Repository Poller {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
=====================

**Note:** This plugin is available for Go servers running on Linux nodes
having repoquery installed (part of the
[yum-utils](http://linux.die.net/man/1/yum-utils) package.
[Ubuntu](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/raring/man1/yum-utils.1.html),
[CentOS](http://rpmfind.net//linux/RPM/centos/6.4/i386/Packages/yum-utils-1.1.30-14.el6.noarch.html)
)

### Introduction {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

The Yum respository poller is a bundled [package
material](package_material.html) plugin capable of polling yum
repositories for rpm packages. Go server interacts with this plugin via
package material plugin interfaces. The plugin makes use of a command
similar to the following to poll the server. So it does not depend on
the files that yum depends on e.g. files under /etc/yum.repos.d

``` {.code}
repoquery --repofrompath=uuid,$REPO_URL --repoid=uuid -q $PACKAGE_SPEC -qf "%{LOCATION}..."
```

A given instance of polling is considered successful if repoquery
returns a single package as output.

### Turn your Maven Nexus Repo into a Yum repo {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Using the [Yum plugin for
Nexus](https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-yum-plugin), it is possible to
automatically create and publish Java artifacts as rpms using the
[rpm-maven-plugin](http://mojo.codehaus.org/rpm-maven-plugin/index.html)
and consume them on the deployment side using rpm or yum. There is a [Go
webinar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFRd_8mbIXI) that describes this
set up.

### Repository definition {#repodefn .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Repo URL must be a valid http, https or file URL. This plugin looks for
the presence of
**\$REPO\_URL/repodata/[repomd.xml](http://createrepo.baseurl.org/wiki)**
to ascertain validity. Basic authentication (user:password@domain/path)
is supported for http and https repositories.

### Package definition {#pkgdefn .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

In case of this plugin, the package definition is completely determined
by the package spec. The package spec may be in any of the following
formats. Please refer the [repoquery man
page](http://linux.die.net/man/1/repoquery) for details.

``` {.code}
                name
                name.arch
                name-ver
                name-ver-rel
                name-ver-rel.arch
                name-epoch:ver-rel.arch
                epoch:name-ver-rel.arch
```

[Shell glob patterns](http://linux.die.net/man/7/glob) may also be used.
For example, say we have a component under development getting ready for
release of version 1.2.0. We cut a branch for the release and bump up
the version on trunk/master to 1.3.0. Thus, a package generated by
trunk/master may look like mycomp-1.3.0-b72349-noarch.rpm while that
generated by branch may look like mycomp-1.2.0-b72344-noarch.rpm. Now if
we have a deployment pipeline that is only interested in 1.2 series
packages, the package spec needs to be mycomp-1.2.\* rather than just
mycomp

### Package Metadata {#pkgmeta .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

The following [rpm
metadata](http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm-snapshot/s1-rpm-inside-tags.html)
is accessed by the plugin

1.  BuildTime (required, automatically set by rpmbuild) - Used by the
    plugin to validate if the package is newer than what was last seen
    by Go. Go displays this field as *Modified On*.
2.  Packager - Go displays this field as *Modified By*. If not provided,
    it is shown as anonymous
3.  URL - Displayed as a *Trackback URL* by Go. **Use this as a means to
    trace back to the job that published the package** (within Go or
    outside) to the yum repository.
4.  BuildHost - Displayed by Go as *Comment: Built on \$BUILDHOST*

### Published Environment Variables {#envvar .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

The following information is made available as environment variables for
tasks:

1.  GO\_PACKAGE\_\<REPO-NAME\>\_\<PACKAGE-NAME\>\_LABEL
2.  GO\_REPO\_\<REPO-NAME\>\_\<PACKAGE-NAME\>\_REPO\_URL
3.  GO\_PACKAGE\_\<REPO-NAME\>\_\<PACKAGE-NAME\>\_PACKAGE\_SPEC
4.  GO\_PACKAGE\_\<REPO-NAME\>\_\<PACKAGE-NAME\>\_LOCATION

Individual plugins may provide additional info via additional
environment variables.

### Downloading RPMs {#download .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Let's say we set up a repository named ORA pointing to
http://public-yum.oracle.com/repo/OracleLinux/OL6/latest/x86\_64 and
define a package gcc with a spec of gcc-4.\* and set it up as material
for a pipeline. To download the package locally on the agent, we could
write a task like this:

``` {.code}
                [go] Start to execute task: <exec command="/bin/bash" >
                <arg>-c</arg>
                <arg>curl -o /tmp/gcc.rpm $GO_PACKAGE_ORA_GCC_LOCATION</arg>
                </exec>
```

When the task executes on the agent, the environment variables get
subsituted as below:

``` {.code}
            [go] Start to execute task: <exec command="/bin/bash" >
            <arg>-c</arg>
            <arg>curl -o /tmp/$GO_PACKAGE_ORA_GCC_LABEL.rpm $GO_PACKAGE_ORA_GCC_LOCATION</arg>
            </exec>.
            ...
            [go] setting environment variable 'GO_PACKAGE_ORA_GCC_LABEL' to value 'gcc-4.4.7-3.el6.x86_64'
            [go] setting environment variable 'GO_REPO_ORA_GCC_REPO_URL' to value 'http://public-yum.oracle.com/repo/OracleLinux/OL6/latest/x86_64'
            [go] setting environment variable 'GO_PACKAGE_ORA_GCC_PACKAGE_SPEC' to value 'gcc-4.*'
            [go] setting environment variable 'GO_PACKAGE_ORA_GCC_LOCATION' to value 'http://public-yum.oracle.com/repo/OracleLinux/OL6/latest/x86_64/getPackage/gcc-4.4.7-3.el6.x86_64.rpm'
            ...
```

Or, to simply pass it as an argument to a deploy script on a remote
server

``` {.code}
                <exec command="/bin/bash">
                    <arg>-c</arg>
                    <arg>ssh server "cd /to/dest/dir;deploy.sh $GO_PACKAGE_ORA_GCC_LOCATION"</arg>
                </exec>
```

### Installing RPMs {#install .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

For self contained packages (no external dependencies other than what is
already installed on the target node), it is just enough to do:

``` {.code}
                rpm -U /path/to/downloaded/pkg.rpm
```

On the other hand, if the package isn't self-contained, we'd run:

``` {.code}
                yum install $GO_PACKAGE_ORA_GCC_LABEL
```

This would require that /etc/yum.repos.d contain the repository
definitions.

### Creating and Publishing RPMs {#create .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Although the support for package as material in Go isn't concerned with
how the packages are created and published, here is a short set of
pointers to information on the web.

-   [Building an RPM using rpmbuild and SPEC
    file](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-rpm1/#first_rpm)
-   [Building using fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/wiki)
-   [Tutorial](http://www.howtoforge.com/creating_a_local_yum_repository_centos)
    to set up a local yum repository using
    [createrepo](http://linux.die.net/man/8/createrepo). Publishing to a
    yum repo simply involves uploading/copying over a new package
    revision at the correct location and running createrepo --update

### Notes {#note .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

1.  This plugin will detect at max one package revision per minute (the
    default interval at which Go materials poll). If multiple versions
    of a package get published to a repo in the time interval between
    two polls, Go will only register the latest version in that
    interval.
2.  This plugin makes use of buildtime in rpm metadata to determine if a
    poll has returned a new result. If for some reason (e.g. timezone
    misconfiguration), the buildtime of pkg-1.1 is less than that of
    pkg-1.0, then the plugin will not register pkg-1.1 as a newer
    package.
3.  The only way to update an rpm is to change the version or release.
    [Republishing](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/71288/does-yum-use-package-buildtime-to-decide-if-a-package-is-newer)
    a different file with the same name and different buildtime won't
    do.
4.  Package groups are not supported.
5.  The [Go command
    repository](https://github.com/goteam/go-command-repo/tree/master/package/rpm)
    has a bunch of commands related to rpm packages.
