Stage Details {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
-------------

The Stage Details page shows the details of a specific stage.

![Stage Details Page](resources/images/cruise/stage_details.png)

#### Key {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

1.  Details of a specific stage run: run number, status, when it was
    triggered, who triggered it, duration of the stage
2.  Name of the stage
3.  The jobs in this stage are grouped based on status: Passed, Failed,
    Cancelled, In Progress. Expand these sections to see the jobs.
4.  Failed jobs: Click the job name to view [job
    details](job_details_page.html) for that job.
5.  Stage History shows the status and the pipeline label in which this
    stage has run. The latest 10 are shown by default. The rest are
    paginated, the user can select to view the details of this
    particular stage in any of the pipeline instances. This will
    indicate if the stage was a re-run and show the stage counter. Click
    on the stage instance in the stage history section to view the stage
    details page for that stage.
6.  Displays a graphical visualization of the pipeline dependency chain.
7.  Lists all the material changes that were part of the build in this
    stage.
8.  Displays detailed information about the jobs in this stage.
9.  Shows the failed build history for tests failing in the stage.
10. Cancelled job. Click the job name to view [job
    details](job_details_page.html) for that job
11. RSS feed for the stage in Atom format
12. Name of the stage

### Failed Build History {#failed_build_history .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Results of test runs from jobs within a stage are aggregated up to the
stage level. Failures are listed under the relevant pipeline instance
label . Tests listed are ones that are failing in the stage instance
currently being viewed. The tests are grouped by pipeline instance in
which they started to fail (and are still failing). This gives you
information about which users' checkins are responsible for test
failures. On clicking the CHANGES link next to the Pipeline Label, the
popup shows you the modifications to materials that have been built in
this instance of the pipeline. All the stage instances till the time
this stage was last seen green are listed in the failed build history.
The pipelines are sorted by [natural
ordering](ordering_of_pipelines.html).

#### Test Failures in the current stage {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Other information that the Failed Build History section on the Stage
Details page shows: (Image need annotation)

1.  Total number of tests run
2.  Total number of failures
3.  Total number of errors
4.  Failing test names grouped by the test suites in which they ran
5.  Details link next to each of the job names which gives a popup with
    the failure/error message with a stack trace caused by the test
6.  Users whose check-ins are responsible for the failing test in a
    given instance.
7.  Pipeline labels where the currently failing tests started failing
    and are still failing in the instance being viewed.
8.  The names of the jobs in which the test ran. Clicking on the job
    name will take you to the job details page.
9.  Shows modifications which caused the stage instance to be triggered.
10. Shows the failure message and stack trace for the test failure/error
    for that job.

#### Example 1 {.collapsed-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

You are viewing stage 'Dev' of pipeline label '60'. The pipeline has
been failing since label '59'. There are currently 4 failing tests. This
is how they are listed.

-   60 has 3 failing test all of which started failing in 60
-   59 and 58 are listed because the 'dev' stage failed but none of the
    currently failing tests started failing because of the changes in 59
    or 58. This could be because the tests that were failing in 59 got
    fixed by the checkins in 60. But these check-ins broke other tests.
    Or this could be because none of the test ran in 59 and 58, an error
    occured before the tests started running.
-   The pipeline instances are listed in [natural
    order](ordering_of_pipelines.html). In this case the schedule and
    natural order are the same.

#### Example 2 {.collapsed-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

You are viewing stage 'Dev' of pipeline label '59'. The pipeline has
been failing since label '65'. There are currently 6 failing tests. This
is how they are listed.

-   The natural order of pipelines is 61, 60, 65, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55.
    This is the order in which they are listed.
-   65's changes caused 2 failing test which are still failing in 61
    (instance being viewed).
-   60 had 1 new failing test which is still failing in 61.
-   61 has 3 newly failing tests.
-   None of the currently failing tests started failing in 59, 58. 57,
    56 or 55.

If there are no tests configured in the stage or Go is still computing
results, this is the message that is displayed.
