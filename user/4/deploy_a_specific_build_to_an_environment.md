Deploy specific revisions of the materials to an environment {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
============================================================

Go allows you to hand pick which revision of your materials you would
like to deploy to your environment. This is a a very common requirement
on larger projects which have multiple materials in their deployment
pipeline. Sometimes you may wish to have control over which revision of
the application is deployed to a particular environment (say UAT).

### Select specific revisions of materials to deploy {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Consider the case where a deployment pipeline 'deploy\_bookstore' has 2
materials - Material 'svn' and upstream pipeline 'bookstore'. It is very
common to know that label, say "3.4-RELEASE" of the dependent pipeline
'bookstore' is stable. All the changes that you want right now in your
UAT environment are made to material 'svn'. In such a scenario when you
deploy "deploy\_bookstore" to UAT, you might always want to select label
"3.4-RELEASE" of pipeline 'bookstore' and the latest (or a known
revision specified by your developer) of material 'svn'.

Once there are any new changes to any of the materials, Go will indicate
to the user that newer revisions are available to deploy. You could use
this information and deploy a custom build with hand picked revision or
deploy the latest available revision.

Steps to select the revisions of materials you want to deploy

-   Navigate to the Environments page and locate the specific deployment
    pipeline you are interested in.
-   Click on "Deploy Specific Revision".
-   ![](resources/images/cruise/release_manager/release_to_production/new_revisions.png)
-   This gives you the list of available revisions for each material
-   Click on the "Revision to Deploy" search box. This will list latest
    5 revisions/labels of your materials ordered by time of check-in
    (latest check-in on top)
-   ![](resources/images/cruise/release_manager/release_to_production/see_all_materials.png)
-   Select the revisions of all the materials that you would like to
    pick for deployment. You can search for the revision you want by
    -   revision hash/pipeline label
    -   check-in comment
    -   user
-   If you do not select a specific revision of a material, then the
    currently deployed revision will be retained.
-   Before clicking on "Deploy Changes", check the "To Deploy" column to
    verify which revision will be deployed.
-   Click "Deploy Changes" to start the deployment.

### Why is the 'Deploy Changes' button disabled? {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

There are 3 reasons this can happen

-   There is a deployment is progress, so another one cannot be started
-   Your deployment pipeline is operating in
    [locked](admin_lock_pipelines.html) mode
-   You do not have sufficient permissions to operate on that pipeline

### Deploying the latest of all materials {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

If you always want to have the latest of all materials deployed to your
environment, then this is how you can use Go to do it.

-   Click on deploy latest
-   This will trigger the deployment pipeline
-   This will pick up the latest available revision of your materials at
    the time the pipeline is scheduled

### Using passwords while deploying {#secure_variables_section .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

-   You can set secure variables in Go that gets passed along as
    environment variables to the executing task. You can use this
    feature to pass passwords to deploy scripts. For e.g., you can
    define a secure variable named 'DB\_DEPLOY\_PASSWORD' and the DB
    password as its value. This value will be encrypted by Go and passed
    along to the task.

    ![](resources/images/cruise/release_manager/release_to_production/secure_variables_admin.png)

-   Also, you can override secure variables when you use the 'Trigger
    With Options' feature.
