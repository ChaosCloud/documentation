Concepts in Go {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
==============

Go is an advanced Continuous Integration and Release Management system.
It takes an innovative approach to managing the build, test and release
process. In order to find your way around Go, you'll need to understand
how Go sees the world. This page explains some basic concepts in Go.

If you want to know more about Continuous Integration, in general, refer
to Martin Fowler's article on the subject: [Continuous
Integration](http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html).

### Build cloud {#agents .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

As with all modern continuous integration systems, Go lets you
distribute your builds across many computers -- think 'build grid' or
'build cloud'.

And why use a build cloud? There are three main reasons:

-   Run your tests on several different platforms to make sure your
    software works on all of them
-   Split your tests into several parallel suites and run them at the
    same time to get results faster
-   Manage all your environments centrally so you can promote builds
    from one environment to the next

It is extremely simple to get a cloud up and running in Go. First,
install the Go agent software on each computer that is to be a part of
your cloud. Next, configure each build agent to connect to your Go
server. Finally, approve every build agent in your cloud from the
management dashboard in the Go administration page. You are now ready to
build. Additionally, you should associate relevant **resource** tags
with each of your agents to better specify the kinds of build tasks with
which each agent is compatible.

#### Agent lifecycle {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Go supports a grid of Agents that can run Jobs. Agents periodically
contact the Go server to ask if there is any work. The server checks to
see what resources the Agent has, and assigns any available Jobs that
match those resources.

When an Agent runs a Job, it creates a sandbox directory under the
agent's directory. All materials are updated into this directory. This
directory may be different on different agents depending on how the
agent was configured and which operating system the agent is running on.

For example consider a pipeline named "pipelines/my-pipeline". On a
default linux install this would be
"/var/lib/go-agent/pipelines/my-pipeline". On a default Windows
installation it would be "C:\\Program files\\Go
Agent\\pipelines\\my-pipeline".

All materials are updated in this directory. If a material has a "dest"
folder specified, then the material is updated into a folder of that
name, under the base sandbox directory.

For example suppose the pipeline has an SVN material with a destination
folder name of "tools" then the svn files will be checked out into that
"tools" directory. When you have multiple materials specified, you must
specify a "dest" for each material.

Once the materials have all been updated, the Agent runs each of the
tasks in turn. You can specify a workingdir on a task. When the task
runs it will be run relative to the pipeline sandbox.

For example if there is a task that runs "/usr/bin/make" with a
workingdir of "tools/my-tool" then this will run in the directory
"pipelines/my-pipeline/tools/my-tool".

When all the tasks have been completed the agent will publish any
artifacts defined in the Job. Again the artifact directories are
relative to the pipeline sandbox directory.

#### Full example {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Consider the following configuration:

``` {.code}
          <pipeline name="my-product">
            <materials>
              <svn  url="http://my-svn-server/tools" dest="tools"/>
              <svn  url="http://my-svn-server/my-project" dest="my-project"/>
            </materials>
            <stage name="compile">
              <job name="linux">
                <environmentvariables>
                  <variable name="FOO">
                     <value>bar</value>
                  </variable>
                </environmentvariables>
                <resources>
                  <resource>linux</resource>
                </resources>
                <tasks>
                  <exec command="/usr/bin/make" args="-f Makefile" workingdir="tools/my-tool"/>
                  <ant target="unit-test" workingdir="my-project"/>
                </tasks>
                <artifacts>
                  <artifact src="my-project/target/deployable.jar" dest="pkg"/>
                </artifacts>
              </job>
            </stage>
          </pipeline>
          
```

The Go Agent will:

-   Create the directory "[install-dir]/pipelines/my-product" if it does
    not exist
-   Checkout or update the svn material "http://my-svn-server/tools"
    into "[install-dir]/pipelines/my-product/tools"
-   Checkout or update the svn material
    "http://my-svn-server/my-project" into
    "[install-dir]/pipelines/my-product/my-project"
-   run "/usr/bin/make" in the directory
    "[install-dir]/pipelines/my-product/tools/my-tool"
-   run ant in the directory
    "[install-dir]/pipelines/my-product/tools/my-project"
-   publish
    "[install-dir]/pipelines/my-product/my-project/target/deployable.jar"
    to the server

### Pipelines {#pipelines .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

A pipeline allows you to break down a complex build into a sequence of
simple stages for fast feedback, exhaustive validation and continuous
deployment.

#### How Go models distributed work {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

The unit of work in Go is called a **job** . A job is a set of build
tasks that can be performed on a single agent in your cloud. You can
associate specific build **resources** with each build agent -- a
specific operating system or compiler version, for example. Go makes
sure build jobs that require specific build resources are directed to
build agents with the appropriate resources. By default, build jobs can
be picked up by any agent. Resources are simple text tags which you
associate with each agent. You can specify as many of them as you want.
This flexibility is important as the agent process itself does not
automatically determine anything about its environment.

Jobs are grouped into stages. A **stage** is a collection of build jobs
that can be executed in parallel. This is the mechanism that allows you
to, for example, split test suites into multiple parallel streams or run
the same build on multiple platforms simultaneously. A stage passes only
when all the jobs in the stage pass.

Stages are then joined sequentially into a **pipeline** . Stages trigger
in the order they appear in the pipeline's raw configuration. They can
be triggered by: a change in your version control system, manually
forcing the pipeline to become active or by a dependency on a given
stage of another pipeline. When a stage completes successfully, it
triggers the next stage in the pipeline automatically, by default.
Alternatively, you can require a manual **approval** to trigger the next
stage. This manual approval requires user intervention. You can delegate
the permissions for approval of stages to individuals or groups of
users.

#### An example pipeline {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

So what does a pipeline look like? Here's an example:

![Example pipeline](resources/images/cruise/pipeline_example.png)

The first stage has two jobs. The unit test job compiles the code and
runs the unit tests. The compiled code is then uploaded to the artifact
repository. This is the one and only time the code is compiled -- and of
course if you're using an interpreted language you can skip this step.
The second job does static analysis of the code, uploading the results
as html test reports and build properties for further analysis.

When the first stage passes, it automatically triggers the functional
test stage. The jobs in this stage download that binaries from the
artifact repository, and run a series of functional tests. One job runs
on a Linux box, the other on Windows. If your tests take a long time to
run, you could split them into suites and run these as multiple jobs in
parallel.

Finally there is a stage which deploys your software into your UAT
environment for manual testing. This stage has a manual approval in
front of it, meaning that somebody has to click a button in order to
deploy the application into UAT. Running this stage proves out your
automated deployment process -- and it should include some smoke tests
that make the job fail if the deployment doesn't work.

The pipeline metaphor gives you several important benefits:

-   Because of the way pipelines are modeled and presented, it is
    trivially easy to match up an acceptance test failure, or a flaw in
    the UAT environment, with the version of the code that caused it.
-   Because you only compile once, you ensure that the thing you are
    testing is the same thing you will release, and you don't waste
    resources compiling repeatedly.
-   Finally, Go allows you to build manual steps into your testing
    process so that your QAs and users can manually test your software.

#### Pipeline groups {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

The Go dashboard allows you to visualize pipelines at a glance. You can
then group pipelines together into pipeline groups. Beyond the visual
convenience of grouping related pipelines, there are access and security
features that allow you to control the set of users that can view a
particular pipeline group. This can be a powerful way to carve out more
secluded build areas for your users. Consult the Security section for
more information

### Pipeline dependencies {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

A dependency is created when a pipeline is configured to depend on
either an SCM or another pipeline. The domain concept for this is called
a material. If a pipeline has a dependency it has been configured to
have either an *SCM material* or a *pipeline material*.

#### SCM Dependency {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

![](resources/images/cruise/scm_dependency.png)

Pipeline 1 depends on an SCM.

Pipeline 1 will trigger each time it polls the SCM and detects a new
revision.

#### Pipeline Dependency {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

![](resources/images/cruise/pipeline_dependency.png)

Pipeline 2 depends on Pipeline 1.

Pipeline 2 will trigger each time Pipeline 1 successfully completes.

#### Pipeline and SCM Dependency {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

![](resources/images/cruise/pipeline_scm_dependency.png)

Pipeline 2 depends on Pipeline 1 and an SCM.

The expectation may be that a new revision will trigger both Pipeline 1
and 2. Thatâs not the case.

Instead, Pipeline 2 will only trigger if a new revision has successfully
passed through Pipeline 1.

Real world example:

SCM contains application code and acceptance tests

Both pipelines depend on the SCM

Pipeline 1 compiles code and creates an artifact

Pipeline 2 fetches the build artifact and runs the tests that were
written for the compiled code

Pipeline 2 has to use the same acceptance tests committed with the code

Someone commits code and tests as part of the same SCM commit.

#### Fan-out {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

![](resources/images/cruise/fan-out.png)

Pipeline 1 and 2 depend on the same SCM.

A new revision will trigger both Pipeline 1 and 2.

Why fan-out?

Speed up the feedback loop and enable a team to fail and learn faster.

#### Fan-in - Pipeline {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

![](resources/images/cruise/fan-in-pipeline.png)

Pipelines 1 and 2 depend on an SCM.

Pipeline 3 depends on Pipelines 1 and 2.

The expectation may be that any successful run of Pipeline 1 or Pipeline
2 will trigger Pipeline 3. Thatâs not the case.

Instead, Pipeline 3 will only trigger if a new revision (SCM) has
successfully passed through both Pipeline 1 and Pipeline 2.

Why fan-in?

Faster feedback - You can fan-out to get significantly faster feedback
now that Go handles the fan-in.

Eliminates spurious builds - Test software only when it's necessary and
donât waste resources.

Meaningful feedback - You won't have false-positives or false-negatives.

#### Fan-in - Pipeline and SCM {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

![](resources/images/cruise/fan-in-pipeline-scm.png)

Pipelines 1 and 2 depend on SCM 1.

Pipeline 3 depends on Pipelines 1 and 2, and SCM 2.

Pipeline 3 will trigger:

if a new revision (SCM 1) has successfully passed through both Pipeline
1 and Pipeline 2

each time it polls SCM 2 and detects a new revision

#### Fan-in - Pipeline with different originating SCM {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

![](resources/images/cruise/fan-in-pipeline-different-scm.png)

Pipelines 1 and 2 depend on SCM 1.

Pipeline 3 depends on SCM 2.

Pipeline 4 depends on Pipelines 1, 2 and 3.

Pipeline 4 will trigger:

if a new revision (SCM 1) has successfully passed through Pipelines 1
and 2.

each time Pipeline 3 successfully completes (SCM 2)

### Deployment and Environments {#deployment_environments .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Any moderately complex piece of software typically goes through a series
of environments prior to release. A typical set of environments may look
like this:

-   Development
-   User Acceptance Testing
-   Performance
-   Production

Deployment of software into an environment is often a non-trivial
process that involves several steps, potentially required to be repeated
on several machines. With Go, you have an easy to manage environment
dashboard that simplifies the deployment process down to a single click.

An environment in Go is essentially a collection of agents and
pipelines. Agents can be shared across environments, however, pipelines
cannot. An environment pipeline is used to perform tasks specific to an
environment.

#### An example {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

So how would this work for me? Here's an example:

![Environments example](resources/images/cruise/environment-deploy.png)

In this scenario, we have three different environments -- User
acceptance, Performance, and Production. At any given time, each
environment may contain a different build of the deployed software.

Each environment has a pipeline (represented by the downward arrow) that
performs a set of tasks specific to each environment.

-   **User Acceptance:** The pipeline performs a **deploy** task on a
    single machine.
-   **Performance:** The pipeline first performs a **deploy** on a
    cluster of performance machines and then triggers a suite of
    **performance tests** .
-   **Production:** The pipeline first performs a **deploy** on a load
    balanced cluster of machines and then triggers a suite of **smoke
    tests** to validate the deployment.

Each of these environment pipelines deploys using the same build thereby
mitigating any unforeseen issues due to inconsistent versions.

The environments dashboard also give you a bird's eye view of which
versions are deployed in which environment giving you a configuration
management console as well.
