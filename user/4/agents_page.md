Agents {.collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}
======

The Agents page lists all the agents available to the server and their
current status.

When an Agent first connects to the Server it is 'Pending'. An
administrator must enable the Agent before Go will schedule work on that
agent.

Administrators can also disable agents. Go will not schedule work for a
disabled Agent. If a job is building on the agent when it is disabled,
that job will be completed; the agent is then disabled. An administrator
will need to enable the Agent before it will again schedule work

Administrators can choose to delete an agent which is no longer
required. The agent must be disabled before it can be deleted. An agent
in a disabled(building) or disabled(cancelled) state cannot be deleted.

### Key {#key .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

1.  Find out how many agents are pending, enabled and disabled.
2.  Status is sorted by default. The order of sort is pending, lost
    contact, missing, building, idle, disabled, cancelled.
3.  Click on a column header to sort by that column.
4.  To enable or disable agents, first select the agents that you are
    interested in. Then click the 'ENABLE' or 'DISABLE' button. If you
    try to disable an agent that is already disabled, or enable an agent
    that is already enabled, Go will ignore that change.
5.  To associate a resource with an agent, first select the agents you
    are interested in. Then click the 'Resources' button. You are now
    able to associate new or existing resources with your agents.
6.  To associate an agent with an environment, first select the agents
    you are interested in. Then click the 'Environments' button. You are
    now able to associate your agents with an environment.
7.  Admin users can click here to get to the [Agent
    details](agent_details.html) of the given agent
8.  Filter the agents list. See the section below.
9.  To delete agents, first select the agents that you are interested
    in. Then click the 'DELETE' button. If you try to delete an agent
    that is in disabled(building) or disabled(cancelled), Go will not
    delete that agent.

### Filtering Agents {#filter_agents .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Since the agent list can become very long, it is useful to be able to
filter it by various criteria. The **Filter** option provides this
functionality.

-   Format: tag:value
-   Supported tags: ip, resource, os, name, status, environment
-   Supported values: Free form text. After you specify a tag, enter a
    value. Go only displays agents containing the entered value.
-   The sort function will work with filtered lists.
-   Entering a tag:value combination that does not match any agents will
    result in an empty result set being displayed.

Examples:

-   If you want to see only missing agents, enter "status:missing".
-   If you want to see only agents with resource names containing
    "java", enter "resource:java".

#### Autocompletion {#autocomplete .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Go support autocompletion of searches. After you specify a tag, Go
suggests possible values for the tag, based on the exsting values
entered. You can choose an appropriate value from the autocompletion
list and then search.

![](resources/images/cruise/agents_autocomplete.png)

A maximum of 10 results is displayed for autocomplete, irrespetive of
the number of actual matches. For best results, ensure sufficient text
is entered to narrow down the number of matches

#### Exact search {#exact_search .collapsible-heading onclick="toggleCollapse($(this));"}

Even with autocomplete, there are some limitations to the search
criteria.

For example **resource:windows** matches both "windows" and
"windows2k3", though you may have wanted an exact match on "windows".
This is because, the current filter is a wildcard search rathern than a
token search

**Exact search** addresses this problem. The way to do exact search is
to use quotes ("") to specify the values. e.g. **resource:"windows"**
will filter and return only those agents whose names are "windows" and
nothing else.

You cannot combine autocomplete and exact search. Once you specify the
values in quotes, autocomplete will be turned off
